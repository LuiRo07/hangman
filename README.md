# hangman

## Description

A terminal program that executes a hangman game, where a user guesses the 
mysterious word before the hangman is drawn. With every wrong answer, a
piece of the hangman is drawn.

## Technologies

- Pure Python
- terminal shell

## Outcome

From building this project, I learned about sequential programming, 
and how game logic can continue to run infinitely until a certain
condition (win or lose) is met.
